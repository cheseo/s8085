s8085 -- A stupid 8085 emulator.

This stupid and inefficient program tries to emulate a 8085 cpu.

Dependencies:
	- gcc (for ##__VA_ARGS__)
	- a system which supports stdint.h
	- make
	- etags (to generate TAGS file)

Compiling & Running:
	Just `make' should give you a executable file called s8085 inside src/ directory.
	./src/s8085 should open it in interactive mode, where it prints the value of
	each register after each command.
